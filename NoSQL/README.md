# NoSQL (Non-Relational Databases)
- **Structure**: NoSQL databases can be document-oriented, key-value pairs, wide-column stores, or graph databases. They are more flexible in terms of the data models they can store.
- **Schema**: They typically have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. Data can be stored without a predefined structure, and the structure can be modified at any time.
- **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale out by distributing data across multiple servers, and they are often used for large data sets or rapidly changing data. This is known as horizontal scaling.
- **Transactions**: While some NoSQL systems offer ACID compliance, it's less common and often less strict compared to SQL databases. Consistency models can vary, with many NoSQL databases using eventual consistency.
- **Examples**: Examples include MongoDB (document-oriented), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (wide-column store), and Neo4j (graph database).
