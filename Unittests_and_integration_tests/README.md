# unittest and integration tests

Writing unit tests and integration tests in Python involves leveraging a suite of tools and libraries that allow for comprehensive testing of individual components (unit tests) as well as the combined operation of multiple components (integration tests). Python's `unittest` framework, along with extensions like `parameterized` for parameterized testing and `unittest.mock` for mocking and patching, are commonly used for this purpose.

### Unit Testing with `unittest` (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
Python's `unittest` module is a standard library module designed for writing and running tests. It provides a rich set of tools for constructing test cases by subclassing `unittest.TestCase`. Each test method within a `TestCase` subclass should test a specific aspect of the code's behavior.

To write a unit test using `unittest`, follow these steps:

1. **Import unittest**: Begin by importing the `unittest` module.

    ```python
    import unittest
    ```

2. **Define Test Cases**: Create a subclass of `unittest.TestCase` and define test methods. Each method should start with the word `test` to be automatically recognized as a test case.

    ```python
    class MyUnitTest(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_some_functionality(self):
            # Arrange
            expected_result = ...

            # Act
            actual_result = function_under_test(...)

            # Assert
            self.assertEqual(actual_result, expected_result)
    ```

3. **Run Tests**: Use `unittest.main()` to run the tests when the script is executed directly.

    ```python
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
    ```

### Parameterized Testing with `parameterized` (https://pypi.org/project/parameterized/)
The `parameterized` extension is used to run a test method multiple times with different arguments. It is particularly useful for covering a broad range of cases with a single test method.

1. **Install `parameterized`**: Ensure the `parameterized` package is installed.

    ```bash
    pip install parameterized
    ```

2. **Use the `parameterized` decorator**: Import and apply the `parameterized.expand` decorator to a test method in your `unittest.TestCase` subclass. Provide a list of parameter tuples for each invocation of the test.

    ```python
    from parameterized import parameterized

    class MyUnitTest(unittest.TestCase):
        
        @parameterized.expand([
            ("case1", arg1, expected1),
            ("case2", arg2, expected2),
            ...
        ])
        def test_with_parameters(self, name, input, expected):
            # Act
            result = function_under_test(input)

            # Assert
            self.assertEqual(result, expected)
    ```

### Mocking with `unittest.mock` (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html#module-unittest.mock)
`unittest.mock` provides a powerful mechanism for replacing parts of your system under test with mock objects and configuring their behavior.

1. **Import Mock**: Import the `mock` object from the `unittest.mock` module.

    ```python
    from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
    ```

2. **Use Mock Objects**: Replace dependencies of the code under test with mock objects. This allows you to simulate various scenarios, such as exceptions, return values, and side effects, without relying on real implementations.

    ```python
    class MyUnitTest(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_function_with_external_dependency(self):
            # Arrange
            mock_dependency = Mock(return_value=expected_result)
            
            # Act
            actual_result = function_under_test(mock_dependency)
            
            # Assert
            self.assertEqual(actual_result, expected_result)
            mock_dependency.assert_called_once_with(...)
    ```

3. **Patch Dependencies**: Use the `patch` decorator or context manager to temporarily replace classes or functions within a module under test. `patch` automatically creates mock objects for the duration of the test and restores the original state afterwards.

    ```python
    class MyUnitTest(unittest.TestCase):
        
        @patch('module_under_test.ClassOrFunctionToMock')
        def test_something_with_patch(self, mock_obj):
            # Configure the mock
            mock_obj.return_value = ...

            # Run the test
            result = function_that_uses_the_mocked_obj(...)
            
            # Assertions and verifications
            self.assertEqual(result, ...)
            mock_obj.assert_called_with(...)
    ```

### Integration Testing
Integration tests verify that different modules or services work together as expected. In Python, you can use the same `unittest` framework for integration testing, but the focus shifts from individual units to interactions and integrations between components.

1. **Write Integration Test Cases**: Define test cases that cover the interaction between components rather than isolated functionality.

    ```python
    class MyIntegrationTest(unittest.TestCase):
        def test_integration_of_components(self):
            # Arrange: Set up the components and their interactions
            
            # Act: Execute the integrated components
            
            # Assert: Verify the interaction and output
    ```

2. **Utilize Mocks Sparingly**: In integration tests, you typically want to involve real components as much as possible. Use mocks primarily to simulate external systems that are out of scope for the test (

like third-party services).

3. **Run the Integration Tests**: Ensure that the environment is set up to closely mimic the production environment where the integration occurs, and then execute the tests.

By combining these tools and methodologies, you can achieve a comprehensive testing strategy that covers both the isolated functionality of individual components and their interactions within the larger system.
